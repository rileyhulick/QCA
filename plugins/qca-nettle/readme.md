QCA plugin based on the Nettle cryptography library

Nettle is a widely deployed library in GNU/Linux, in no small part because it is
a dependency of GnuTLS. It's lighter weight than Botan, OSSL, and NSS, and a bit
more portable than LibGCrypt. Nettle also supports hardware acceleration for a
wide range of CPU architectures.
