QCA plugin based on tiny-aes-c

tiny-aes-c is a very small pure software implementation of the AES cipher. It 
has zero dependencies and is small enough to be statically linked to this 
plugin, making it useful for edge cases where no other AES support is available 
or where a pure software implementation is desired.
